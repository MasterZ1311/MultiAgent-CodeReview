## 1. Executive Overview & Phase 1 Objectives

Phase 1 of the **CodeVault AI** platform delivers the core foundational runtime, asynchronous orchestration architecture, and primary code review capabilities. Powered by IBM watsonx Granite foundation models and LangGraph state graphs, Phase 1 establishes an enterprise-grade multi-agent system designed to review source code across security, performance, testability, documentation, and best practices.

### Key Architectural Pillars
- **Deterministic State Graph Execution**: State transitions and agent executions are orchestrated via LangGraph `StateGraph(ReviewState)` supporting asynchronous fan-out dispatch and fan-in aggregation.
- **Resilient Multi-Agent Isolation**: Every agent executes within isolated try/catch boundaries with typed reducers. A single agent crash never crashes the pipeline; it marks the system status as `degraded` and assigns a score of `0.0` to the failing agent without score inflation.
- **Persistent Resource Management**: Asynchronous PostgreSQL connection pooling (`asyncpg` + SQLAlchemy 2.0) and two-tier Redis LRU caching guarantee resource bounds under high-throughput review bursts.
- **Strict Cryptographic Authentication**: Bearer token authentication validated via constant-time SHA-256 hash lookups (`cvai_` prefix enforcement) prevents unauthorized access.

## 4. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: watsonx API Rate Limiting & Read Timeout During Concurrent Review Burst
- **Symptoms**:
  - Review latency spikes from standard 3.5s baseline to > 30.0s.
  - Server logs display: `httpx.ReadTimeout: timed out` or `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded`.
  - Prometheus alert fires: `LLMRateLimitExceeded` (`rate(llm_client_errors_total[5m]) > 5`).
- **Root Cause Diagnosis**:
  - A burst of concurrent pull request submissions exhausted the provisioned watsonx TPM (tokens per minute) or RPM (requests per minute) quota.
  - Asynchronous HTTP requests did not enforce client-side token bucket rate limiting and lacked exponential backoff with jitter.
- **Step-by-Step Remediation**:
  1. Wrap all calls in `WatsonxProvider` with a token bucket limiter matching the provisioned tier.
  2. Implement exponential backoff with full randomized jitter:
     ```python
     # File: src/codevault/providers/watsonx_provider.py
     import random
     import asyncio

     async def call_watsonx_with_retry(prompt: str, retries: int = 3) -> str:
         base_delay = 1.0
         max_delay = 10.0
         for attempt in range(retries):
             try:
                 return await client.generate(prompt)
             except (httpx.ReadTimeout, httpx.HTTPStatusError) as exc:
                 if attempt == retries - 1:
                     raise
                 jittered_delay = min(max_delay, base_delay * (2 ** attempt)) + random.uniform(0, 0.5)
                 await asyncio.sleep(jittered_delay)
     ```
  3. Trip the circuit breaker after 3 consecutive failures to transition the orchestrator into local heuristic AST mode.
- **Verification**:
  - Execute a Locust load test firing 50 concurrent requests. Verify that upstream 429 errors drop to zero, degraded reviews complete within 2.5s using heuristic engines, and circuit breaker recovers automatically when watsonx health check succeeds.

### Scenario 2: Memory Exhaustion (OOMKilled) Due to Unbounded In-Memory Caches & WebSocket Buffers
- **Symptoms**:
  - Kubernetes API server restarts the `codevault-api` pod with termination reason `OOMKilled` (`ExitCode: 137`).
  - Container resident set size (RSS) memory steadily climbs under load without stabilizing.
- **Root Cause Diagnosis**:
  - The local in-memory fallback cache was implemented using a raw Python `dict` with no maximum size bounds or LRU eviction policy.
  - WebSocket broadcast channels retained unconsumed message buffers for disconnected browser clients.
- **Step-by-Step Remediation**:
  1. Replace unbounded dictionary caches with bounded `OrderedDict` implementations enforcing strict capacity:
     ```python
     # File: src/codevault/core/cache.py
     from collections import OrderedDict

     class BoundedLRUCache:
         def __init__(self, maxsize: int = 5000):
             self.maxsize = maxsize
             self.cache: OrderedDict[str, Any] = OrderedDict()

         def set(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:
             if key in self.cache:
                 self.cache.move_to_end(key)
             self.cache[key] = value
             if len(self.cache) > self.maxsize:
                 self.cache.popitem(last=False)
     ```
  2. Enforce strict buffer bounds on WebSocket message queues and unregister disconnected sockets immediately.
  3. Set Kubernetes memory requests and limits: `requests: 2Gi`, `limits: 4Gi`.
- **Verification**:
  - Run a 24-hour memory soak test simulating continuous review ingestion. Verify process RSS memory stabilizes at approximately 1.4Gi with zero OOM crash events.

### Scenario 3: Database Connection Pool Starvation (`asyncpg.exceptions.TooManyConnectionsError`)
- **Symptoms**:
  - Client review submissions fail with HTTP 500: `asyncpg.exceptions.TooManyConnectionsError: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections`.
  - Database queries hang until hitting the 30-second pool timeout.
- **Root Cause Diagnosis**:
  - Background worker tasks acquired sessions without using asynchronous context managers, causing unclosed connections to leak on unhandled exceptions.
  - PostgreSQL server `max_connections` (100) was exceeded by multiple replica pods each configuring `pool_size=30` and `max_overflow=20`.
- **Step-by-Step Remediation**:
  1. Refactor all database session interactions to strictly use asynchronous context managers:
     ```python
     # File: src/codevault/core/database.py
     async with session_factory() as session:
         async with session.begin():
             # Execute transactional logic
     ```
  2. Enforce `pool_size=20`, `max_overflow=10`, `pool_recycle=1800`, and `pool_pre_ping=True` in `DatabaseConfig`.
  3. Deploy PgBouncer in transaction pooling mode between the API pods and PostgreSQL cluster.
- **Verification**:
  - Run `pgbench` against the database while dispatching 100 concurrent review submissions. Query `SELECT count(*), state FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;` and confirm active connections remain bounded below 80% of server capacity.

---

### Scenario 4: Partial Agent Failure Producing Inflated Scores or Zombie States
- **Symptoms**:
  - A pull request review finishes with `status="completed"` and an inflated `overall_score=100.0`, even though the Security Agent crashed during execution.
  - Critical SQL injection and credential leaks are omitted from the review report.
- **Root Cause Diagnosis**:
  - The orchestrator node swallowed the exception from the failing agent and defaulted its score to 100.0, or omitted it from the weighted score divisor.
- **Step-by-Step Remediation**:
  1. Modify orchestrator agent node exception handlers to explicitly capture errors, assign `score=0.0`, and mark agent status as `failed`:
     ```python
     # File: src/codevault/orchestration/master_orchestrator.py
     except Exception as exc:
         failed_res = AgentResult(agent_name="security", status="failed", score=0.0, error=str(exc))
         return {"agent_results": {"security": failed_res}, "errors": [f"SecurityAgent: {str(exc)}"]}
     ```
  2. In `ResultAggregationService`, calculate weighted sum assigning 0.0 to failed agents while retaining their full weight in the denominator.
  3. Set overall review status to `degraded` if any agent fails, and suppress writing degraded results to Redis cache.
- **Verification**:
  - Inject an intentional `raise RuntimeError("Simulated crash")` inside `SecurityReviewAgent.analyze()`. Verify that the returned response has `status="degraded"`, `overall_score <= 60.0`, and `agent_results["security"]["score"] == 0.0`.

---

### Scenario 5: WebSocket Connection Leak on Abrupt Client Network Disconnect
- **Symptoms**:
  - Open file descriptors on the API server climb continuously (`lsof -p <pid> | wc -l`), eventually triggering OS error: `OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files`.
  - Stale client entries remain in memory registries indefinitely.
- **Root Cause Diagnosis**:
  - When clients disconnect abruptly (e.g., closing browser tabs or losing network connectivity), the server-side WebSocket reader hung waiting for input without receiving a clean TCP FIN packet.
- **Step-by-Step Remediation**:
  1. Implement a 15-second bidirectional heartbeat ping/pong loop:
     ```python
     # File: src/codevault/api/v1/endpoints/streaming.py
     try:
         while True:
             await asyncio.wait_for(websocket.send_json({"type": "ping"}), timeout=5.0)
             msg = await asyncio.wait_for(websocket.receive_text(), timeout=15.0)
     except (WebSocketDisconnect, asyncio.TimeoutError):
         connection_manager.disconnect(client_id)
     ```
  2. Enforce socket cleanup in a guaranteed `finally:` block:
     ```python
     finally:
         await connection_manager.close_and_remove(websocket, client_id)
     ```
- **Verification**:
  - Simulate 200 WebSocket clients abruptly severing connections via TCP RST packets. Monitor server file descriptor counts and confirm descriptors return to baseline within 20 seconds.
